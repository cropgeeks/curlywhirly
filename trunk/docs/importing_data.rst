Importing Data
==============
Import data into CurlyWhirly by either selecting Import a file into CurlyWhirly from CurlyWhirly's welcome screen, the Open data button from the toolbar, or by dragging and dropping a CurlyWhirly formatted data file onto the CurlyWhirly window.

CurlyWhirly will now import your data and display it on the main canvas, replacing the welcome screen. You should see a basic 3D plot of the data points in your data set, with X, Y and Z axes displayed as well. The left hand panel will now display the categories (and values associated with those categories) that were found in your data set.
