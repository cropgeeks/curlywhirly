<h4>
	Data format
	<a name="dataformat"></a>
</h4>
<p>
The CurlyWhirly data format supports multiple columns with category information, allowing users to categorize their data in different ways.
</p>
<p>
It is a tab delimited text format with a header which specifies the category groups which categories are found in, as well as the axis names for the data set. The category column header should start with the prefix "categories:" and the header line for the column which contains your data point names should be "label".
</p>
<p>
A header line should resemble the following:
</p>
categories:size --> categories:age --> Label --> PCO1 --> PCO2 --> PCO3
<p>
An <a href="exampleDataCurlyWhirly.txt">example data file</a> is available.

<h4>
	Loading data
	<a name="loadingdata"></a>
</h4>
You can load data into CurlyWhirly by clicking the "Open data" button on the toolbar, or the "Import a file into CurlyWhirly" link on the "Welcome to CurlyWhirly" screen. In both cases simply select your desired file and it will be loaded. Additionally you can drag and drop a data file onto CurlyWhirly which automatically loads the file.

<h4>
	Background colour
	<a name="bgcolour"></a>
</h4>
To change the background colour, or infact any of the customizable colours within CurlyWhirly, click the "Options" button on the toolbar to open up the CurlyWhirly Options dialog. In the dialog click the "Customize colours" button to display the Customize Colours dialog, double click the OpenGLPanel.background entry and select a new colour using the colour chooser. This - and any other customised colours - is stored by CurlyWhrily for future use in addition to immediately changing the background colour.

<h4>
	Highlighting subsets of data
	<a name="subsets"></a>
</h4>
In the first tab of the control panel is a listing of all the category groups in the data set and their associated categories. By default the first category group is selected, which means that it is used to colour data points. You can select and deselect categories from any category group and this affects the 3D display. If you deselect a a category, any data point which is associated with that category will be coloured grey, instead of the colour of the category associated with that data point in the current category group. You can use this selection / deselection mechanism to iteratively filter down to a set of coloured points that you are interested in looking at.

	<a name="datapoints"></a>
</h4>
Position the mouse over a data point and its individual label (as supplied in the data file) will be displayed
in the status bar at the bottom left corner of the application.
