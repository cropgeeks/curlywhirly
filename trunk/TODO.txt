Collections not updated:

Class										Variable										Reason
ClassificationScheme						categoryNamesVec								Is used in MTControlPanel to set data on a list control. Requires more careful refactoring.
DataSet										dataHeaders										Used to set comboBoxModels in MTControlPanel. Requires more careful refactoring.
MTControlPanel								schemeNames (setupCategoryLists())				Used to set comboBoxModels. Requires more careful refactoring.


Issues that really need examining:

Class 										Method / Problem								Reason
DataLoader									readFile										The file reading code here needs a proper clean up. It should be brought in line with our usual practices.
CWUtils										visitURL5										Old code from when OS X could only run JDK5?
DataLoadingDialog							main											Should this class really have a main?
GUIUtils									visitURL5										May be a more general point. This seems to be duplicate code with stuff in CWUtils.
Label										static initialization block						Why is there a static initialization block?
MTControlPanel								Left explicit import							Import collision on java.awt.list and java.util.list.
MTControlPanel								selectorListValueChanged						It just needs looking at...
MainCanvas									Left explicit import							Import collision on java.awt.list and java.util.list.
MainCanvas									updateGraph										Raw List (selectedCategories) and selectedObjects is an Object[].
MovieAssembleDialog							main 											Shouldn't really have a main.


MovieCaptureDialog							captureMovie()									Refactor so that Movie isn't being captured from within the dialog.
